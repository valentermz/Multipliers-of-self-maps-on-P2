# A case study

We define a concrete endomorphism and perform all the computations that are described in the paper on this particular example. Most of the computations are in the *SageMath* notebook `case-study.ipynb`, except for the Gr√∂bner basis computations, which were done using *Macaulay2*. The source code is in `Test/compute-h.m2`, and the output generated by this file is `./case-study_gb-computations_OUTPUT`.

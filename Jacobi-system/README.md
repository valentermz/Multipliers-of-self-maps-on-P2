# System of equations comming from the Jacobi formula

Using the Jacobi formula we obtain a system of 5 polynomial equations on 4 unknowns: `a, b, x, y`. We prove that in this ideal there exist:

* A quadratic equation on `b` with coefficients polynomials in `t_k, d_k`,

* A linear equation on `a, b` with coefficients polynomials in `t_k, d_k`,

* Two independen linear equations on `x, y` with coefficients polynomials in `a, b, t_k, d_k`.

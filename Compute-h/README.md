# Compute the polynomials h

Given a collection of eight numbers `t_0, d_0, ..., t_3, d_3`, and a rational invariant function `sigma` on the variables `u_4, ..., v_6`, compute the degree four polynomial `h` that defines `sigma` as a multivalued function of `t, d`.

Before running these programs the user has to define rational values for the imput variables `t_k, d_k`.

We include two versions of the same algorithm: an interactive Jupyter notebook and a simpler `.sage` script. For details on the computations see the notebook version.

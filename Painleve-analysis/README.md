They are all SageMath files. The article explains what these programs do as they are being referred to.

The programs `extract_lines.sage` and `remove_squares.sage` run almost instantly. The program  `7th_2neg.sage` runs in under three minutes; `7th_2pos.sage` in less than four hours. Finally, `7th_geq3.sage` takes around a week (all these times in a personal computer).

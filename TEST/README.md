# The `TEST`

Given a collection of fourteen numbers `u_i, v_i`, `i=0,...,6`, test whether or not the collection may be realized as the multipliers of a quadratic endomorphism with an invariant line.  

Before running these programs the user has to define rational values for the imput variables. There are two options:

* Provide `u_i, v_i` for `i = 0,...,6`,
* provide `t_k, d_k` for `i = 0,...,3` and `u_i, v_i` for `i = 4,5,6`.

We include two versions of the same test: an interactive Jupyter notebook and a simpler `.sage` script. For details on the computations see the notebook version.
